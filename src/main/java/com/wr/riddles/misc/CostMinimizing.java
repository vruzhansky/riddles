 * A man has to travel for given number of days by bus. He can buy either:
 * <p>
 * 1 day ticket for 2$ (valid for 1 day)
 * 7 days ticket for 7$ (valid for 7 consecutive days)
 * 30 days ticket for 25$ (valid for 30 consecutive days)
 * We are given an array, whose elements are the day numbers on which he travels.
 * <p>
 * For example, if the given array is {1,3,5,8,9,10}, then he travels on these 6 days.
 * Now we have to minimize the cost of his travel
